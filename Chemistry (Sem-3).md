### Phase:
Homogenous, physically distinct and mechanically separable portion of system is termed as _phase_.

#### Example:
Ice ⇌ Water ⇌ Vapour<br>
Number of phases = 3

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(solid) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(gas) ⇌ NH<sub>3</sub>(gas) + HCl(gas)<br>
Number of phases = 2

CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Number of phases = 3

* Usually all the gaseous components are taken as one phase (because they are usually miscible)
* Usually all solid components are taken as separate phases as long as they are not miscible like in alloys.
* Number of phases of liquids depends on their misciblity. (Usually only one phase exists.)
    Eg:
        * H<sub>2</sub>O and ethanol have **one phase**.
        * Benzene and ethanol have **two phases**.

### Component:
The smallest number of independent variable components by which each phase can be expressed either in the form of chemical formula or by chemical eq<sup>n</sup>.

#### Example:
Ice ⇌ Water ⇌ Vapour<br>
Number of phases = 3<br>
Component = 1 as all the phases can be expressed by a single formula H<sub>2</sub>O.

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(solid) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(gas) ⇌ NH<sub>3</sub>(gas) + HCl(gas)<br>
The proportions of NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl are equivalent and hence the two phases can be expressed in terms of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl alone hence, the number of components is 1. However, if NH<sub>3</sub> or HCl is in excess,  number of components increases to 2.

CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Number of phases = 3, Components = 2 (Any two can be taken as the components)

### Degrees of freedom:
Degrees of freedom is the number of independently variable factors like temperature, pressure and concentration of the phases which need to be specified to represent a system.<br>
Ice ⇌ Water ⇌ Vapour<br>
This equilibrium will exist only at a certain temperature (0.0098<sup>o</sup>C) and pressure (4.58 mm of Hg) i.e. there are no variables that can be arbitrarily set therefore **F=0** and the system is called **invariant** and **zerovariant**.

## Reduced/condensed phase rule:
Two component alloy systems (solid solutions) is what we usually be dealing with in our studies here.

In these systems _solid ⇌ liquid_ equilibrium will exist and there is no gas phase practically which implies that effect of pressure is smallon these types of equilibrium. Therefore are usually conducted at atmospheric pressure which means that pressure could be taken as constant. This reduces the degrees of freedom of the system by one and phase rule becomes **_F=C-P+1_**.

### Eutectic system:
If the two constituents are mixing in each other and are capable of lowering each other's melting point, they will constitute a **eutectic system**.

#### Silver-lead system:
Silver has a melting point of **961<sup>o</sup>C.** Lead has a melting point of **327.5<sup>o</sup>C.**
![Silver-lead temperature-vs-component graph](Images/chem%20notes_2.jpg)

AO → Melting point curve for silver
BO → Melting point curve for lead
 O → Eutectic point

AO indicates that melting point of silver falls gradually on addition of lead in small quantities till the solution gets saturated w.r.t. lead at point O. F=1 along AO.

Along BO, melting point gradually falls on addition of silver in small quantities till the lowest point O is reached. At this point, the solution gets saturated w.r.t. silver and the melting point doesnt fall any further. Along this curve, the system is univariant.

At point O, the system becomes invariant as the temperature and composition become fixed.

If a sample of lead containing less than 2.6% silver is heated to point P, on allowing the mass to cool from P, temperature gradually falls without any change in composition till point P' is reached on the curve BO. On further lowering the temperature, lead begins to separate out and the composition varies along P'O till point O is reached. On further cooling, the whole mass solidifies and lock to the eutectic composition. Likewise, if a sample is containing more than 2.6% Ag, the path P<sub>1</sub> → P'<sub>1</sub> → O is followed.

The same principle is utilised in Pattinson's process of desilverisation of argentiferous lead.
**Desilverisation of argentiferous lead** meains attainment of eutectic composition.
