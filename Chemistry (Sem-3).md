### Phase:
Homogenous, physically distinct and mechanically separable portion of system is termed as _phase_.

#### Example:
Ice ⇌ Water ⇌ Vapour<br>
Number of phases = 3

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(solid) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(gas) ⇌ NH<sub>3</sub>(gas) + HCl(gas)<br>
Number of phases = 2

CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Number of phases = 3

* Usually all the gaseous components are taken as one phase (because they are usually miscible)
* Usually all solid components are taken as separate phases as long as they are not miscible like in alloys.
* Number of phases of liquids depends on their misciblity. (Usually only one phase exists.)
    Eg:
        * H<sub>2</sub>O and ethanol have **one phase**.
        * Benzene and ethanol have **two phases**.

### Component:
The smallest number of independent variable components by which each phase can be expressed either in the form of chemical formula or by chemical eq<sup>n</sup>.

#### Example:
Ice ⇌ Water ⇌ Vapour<br>
Number of phases = 3<br>
Component = 1 as all the phases can be expressed by a single formula H<sub>2</sub>O.

NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(solid) ⇌ NH<sub>4</sub>Cl(gas) ⇌ NH<sub>3</sub>(gas) + HCl(gas)<br>
The proportions of NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl are equivalent and hence the two phases can be expressed in terms of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl alone hence, the number of components is 1. However, if NH<sub>3</sub> or HCl is in excess,  number of components increases to 2.

CaCO<sub>3</sub>(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO<sub>2</sub>(g)<br>
Number of phases = 3, Components = 2 (Any two can be taken as the components)
